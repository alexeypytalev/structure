            p Straddle is a neutral options strategy that involves simultaneously buying both a put option and a call option for the underlying security with the same strike price and the same expiration date. 
            p A trader will profit from a long straddle when the price of the security rises or falls from the strike price by an amount more than the total cost of the premium paid.
